## Global Payment Reconciliation V1 System

### Core Features
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Amazon UK/US, Shopify, Flipkart, and other marketplace data ingestion
- **Multi-Currency Processing**: Automated conversion to base currency (INR, GBP, AED, SGD, USD)
- **Automated Matching**: Intelligent order-to-payout reconciliation with configurable tolerance levels
- **Mismatch Detection**: Real-time identification of payment discrepancies with severity classification
- **Task Integration**: Automatic RECONCILE task creation for significant mismatches (>$10 = P1 priority)

- **API Routes**: `/api/recon/*` endpoints for file upload, batch management, and row operations
- **Frontend Pages**: Reconciliation dashboard (`/recon`) and detail view (`/recon/:batchId`)
- **Database Schema**: ReconBatch and ReconRow models with full audit trail support
- **File Processing**: Multer-based CSV upload with normalized header processing

2. **Processing**: Automated parsing, normalization, and currency conversion
3. **Matching**: Order-to-payout matching with difference calculations
4. **Analysis**: Mismatch detection and severity classification
5. **Action**: Automatic task creation for discrepancies requiring investigation
