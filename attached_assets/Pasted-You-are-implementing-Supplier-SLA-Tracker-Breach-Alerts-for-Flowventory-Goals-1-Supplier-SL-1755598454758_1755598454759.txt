You are implementing “Supplier SLA Tracker + Breach Alerts” for Flowventory.
 
Goals:
1) Supplier SLA metrics
   - Extend supplier model with:
     { leadTimeDays: number, onTimeTargetPct: number (default 90), defectTargetPct: number (default 2) }
   - Compute per supplier (rolling 90 days):
     onTimeRatePct, avgLeadTimeDays, defectRatePct
   - Show these metrics in Suppliers table columns + Supplier detail view with mini charts/badges.
 
2) PO SLA tracking
   - For each PO with a supplier, calculate:
     promisedETA = PO.createdAt + supplier.leadTimeDays
     statusChip: “Due in Xd” (green/amber) or “Overdue by Xd” (red)
   - In PO list + PO detail, display this SLA chip.
 
3) Breach alerts
   - If a PO passes promisedETA without receipt (status != Received/Closed), mark as SLA breach.
   - Log breach event to Activity log.
   - Push a notification (UI bell). If SMTP configured, allow optional email to ops@supplierTeam (toggle in settings).
 
4) Supplier Analytics tab (inside Suppliers)
   - Cards:
     - “Avg Lead Time (90d)” (global + by supplier)
     - “On-time % (90d)” with red/amber/green thresholds
     - “Defect Rate (90d)”
   - Table: Supplier, POs (90d), On-time %, Avg Lead Time, Defect %, Breaches (count), Actions (View)
 
5) Settings → Supplier Management (extend)
   - onTimeTargetPct (default 90)
   - defectTargetPct (default 2)
   - enableEmailOnBreach (boolean)
   - save in settings.json (or local storage if mocking)
 
6) Mock data + fixtures
   - Seed a few POs with createdAt and receivedAt to simulate on-time/late/defective outcomes.
   - Compute metrics from these fixtures so UI is populated.
 
7) UI polish
   - Status badges: green (on target), amber (near threshold), red (breach).
   - Tooltips explaining how metrics are computed.
   - Keep consistent neon SaaS styling.
 
8) API stubs
   - GET /api/suppliers/metrics
   - GET /api/pos?supplierId=...
   - POST /api/alerts/breach (no-op or console.log in mock)
   - Persist settings to the same mechanism as existing Workspace Settings.
 
Deliver:
- Suppliers table updated with SLA columns.
- Supplier detail page with metrics & mini charts.
- PO list/detail shows SLA chip (Due in / Overdue).
- Breach notifications working (UI; email optional if SMTP set).
- Settings extended with targets & breach email toggle.
