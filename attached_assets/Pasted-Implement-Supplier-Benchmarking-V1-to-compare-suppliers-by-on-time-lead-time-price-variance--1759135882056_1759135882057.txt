Implement “Supplier Benchmarking (V1)” to compare suppliers by on-time %, lead time, price variance, and defect/return rate.
Frontend-first, persist via localStorage.

GOALS
- Give founders a ranking of suppliers per SKU/category.
- Surface quick actions: Create PO, Nudge supplier, Open SLA.

DATA (localStorage)
- "flowventory:suppliers": [{ id, name, region, leadTimeDays?, contactEmail?, phone? }]
- "flowventory:purchaseOrders": [
    { id, number, supplierId, createdAt, expectedAt, receivedAt?, items:[{ productId, qty, unitPrice }] , status }
  ]
- "flowventory:returns": [{ id, ts, productId, supplierId?, qty, reason }]  // optional
- "flowventory:products": [{ id, sku, name, category? }]
- "flowventory:sla": [{ supplierId, targetLeadTimeDays: number, targetOnTimePct: number }] // optional

DERIVED METRICS (compute client-side, last 90 days by default)
- onTimePct = (# POs with receivedAt <= expectedAt) / (# received POs)
- avgLeadTime = avg( receivedAt - createdAt ) on received POs
- priceVar (per product) = (unitPrice - medianPriceForProduct) / medianPriceForProduct
- defectRate (if returns exist) = returnedQtyFromSupplier / totalQtyFromSupplier

ROUTES & UI
- /suppliers/benchmark
  - Filters: date range (default 90d), category/SKU, region
  - Table columns: Supplier, On-time %, Avg Lead Time, Price Variance (median), Defect/Return %, PO Count, Actions
  - Sortable by any metric; default sort On-time % desc, then Lead Time asc
  - Row actions:
     * “Create PO” (prefill supplier)
     * “Open Supplier” (detail page)
     * “Nudge” (opens email compose modal with canned template)
  - Trend mini-sparkline (optional): lead time over time

SCORE
- score = (onTimePct * 0.5) + (normalizedLeadTime * 0.3) + (1 - priceVarNormalized) * 0.2
  (simple 0–100; show “Top Choice”, “Consider”, “Watchlist” badge)

PERSISTENCE
- Save last used filters to "flowventory:views:supplierBenchmark"

ACCEPTANCE (Frontend)
- Changing filters re-computes metrics immediately
- Sorting works; badges reflect score bands
- Create PO opens with supplier preselected
- Export CSV button downloads the table with computed metrics
