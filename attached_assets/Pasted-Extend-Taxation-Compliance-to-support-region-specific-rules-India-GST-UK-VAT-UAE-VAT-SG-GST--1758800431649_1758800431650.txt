UI/LOGIC
1) Settings → Finance
   - Allow editing region rule tables (rates/categories); for IN/US also allow per-state rate editing.
 
2) Product
   - Optional per-SKU tax category selector (use region’s categories: standard/reduced/zero). This picks the rule for that line.
 
3) Invoice/Order creation
   - Select Region & Place of Supply (for IN/US: choose State)
   - TAX CALC:
     - UK/UAE/SG: apply selected category rule rate per line (override by SKU category if set).
     - INDIA:
       - If customer.state == your business.state → split the line tax into CGST = rate/2 and SGST = rate/2.
       - Else (inter-state) → IGST = full rate.
       - Store taxBreakup on the invoice.
     - USA:
       - Use customer.state rate if present; else default us_std.
   - Totals box shows sub, tax, grand; for IN shows CGST/SGST/IGST lines.
   - Print view shows region-appropriate labels (VAT/GST/Sales Tax).
 
4) Compliance page (/compliance)
   - Add region-specific exports:
     - UK: VAT summary (net, tax, gross by tax category)
     - UAE/SG: VAT/GST summary by category
     - IN: GSTR-1 style summary (mock): B2B outward supplies by tax rate + CGST/SGST/IGST totals
     - US: Sales Tax by state
   - CSV export per region + date range with columns suited to that region.
 
5) Validations
   - Tax rate between 0..1
   - India: must select both your business state (settings) and customer state to compute CGST/SGST vs IGST.
   - US: if customer.state missing, warn and fall back to default us_std.
   - Per-SKU tax category overrides region default.
 
SEED
- Add one customer per region; include Indian/US customers with states.
- Seed two invoices per region to make reports non-empty.
 
ACCEPTANCE (Frontend)
- Create an invoice in UK with “Reduced 5%” → totals reflect 5% VAT.
- Create an invoice in UAE with 0% (zero-rated) → tax lines show 0.
- Create an invoice in India with same state (e.g., your biz = KA, customer = KA) → CGST/SGST split equally.
- Create another with different state (KA → MH) → IGST only.
- Create an invoice in the US with customer state NY → rate = 8.875%; report shows NY row.
- /compliance exports correct CSV per region with proper columns.
