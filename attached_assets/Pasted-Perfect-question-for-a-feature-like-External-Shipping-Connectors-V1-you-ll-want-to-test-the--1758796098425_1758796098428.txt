Perfect question 👌 — for a feature like External Shipping Connectors (V1), you’ll want to test the front-end flow very deliberately. Here’s a clear checklist you can hand to your developer or QA to verify everything is wired correctly:
 
 
---
 
🔑 Settings → Shipping Integrations
 
Empty State:
If no connectors are set up, does the UI show an empty state with an “Add Connector” button?
 
Add Connector Modal:
Can you open the modal, select a provider (Shiprocket, DHL, UPS, FedEx), enter credentials, and save?
 
Connector List:
After saving, does the connector appear in the list with the correct provider logo, name, and status badge (Configured/Not Configured)?
 
Edit & Delete:
Can you click edit, update credentials, and see the change persist? Can you delete the connector, and does the UI refresh correctly?
 
Test Connection:
If the “Test” button exists, does it show success/failure and surface any AUTH_ERROR cleanly?

📦 Orders → Create Shipment
 
Get Rates:
When creating a shipment and selecting a connector, does the “Get Rates” button fetch and display rate cards?
→ Check: service name, ETA, currency, amount.
 
Create Shipment:
After selecting a rate, does “Create Shipment” produce a Shipment object with:
 
ID / Number
 
Tracking ID
 
Tracking URL
 
Cost (currency + amount)
 
Label (HTML or PDF link)?
 
 
Error Handling:
If credentials are missing or invalid, does the frontend show a user-friendly toast (not a raw API error)?

🚚 Shipments → List & Detail
 
Shipment List View:
 
Does each shipment show its “Source” (which connector it used)?
 
Does the list persist across reloads (fetched from backend, not just local)?
 
 
Detail Page:
 
Does it display tracking ID, tracking URL, label link, and current status?
 
Do timeline events (tracking updates) render cleanly?
 
 
Update Tracking:
 
Clicking “Update Tracking” should refresh the status via the adapter.
 
 
Sync All:
 
If you click “Sync All,” do multiple shipments refresh together?
 
 
 
 
---
 
🔔 Webhooks (if provider supports it)
 
Simulated POST:
POST a sample payload to /webhooks/{provider}. Does the shipment update in the frontend UI automatically (after a refresh/poll)?
→ e.g., status moves from In Transit → Delivered.
 
 
 
---
 
🚨 Edge Case Checks
 
Wrong credentials entered → Does the UI clearly flag an AUTH_ERROR with a call to action (“Fix credentials”)?
 
No rates returned → Does the UI show “No services available” gracefully instead of breaking?
 
Create shipment failed → Does the order still exist, but shipment shows as failed with retry option?
 
Deleted connector with existing shipments → Do old shipments remain visible but marked with “Connector removed”?

👉 If you want, I can also draft a front-end acceptance script (step-by-step in plain English, like “Click here, expect this”) so even a non-technical tester could follow it. Would you like me to prepare that?
