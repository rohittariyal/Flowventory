You are updating the Flowventory app. Fix the Customers module so "Add Customer" opens an inline modal and never navigates to a blank route.
 
GOALS
- Customers live under /customers.
- Add/Edit happens in a modal over the list (NO navigation).
- Persist customers to localStorage (key: "flowventory:customers").
- Seed 2 example customers on first run.
- Defensive rendering to avoid blanks/errors.
 
CHANGES TO MAKE
1) ROUTES
- Ensure routes (React Router) include:
  <Route path="/customers" element={<CustomersPage />} />
  (Optional for viewing): <Route path="/customers/:id" element={<CustomerProfile />} />
- Make sure the sidebar links to "/customers".
 
2) CUSTOMERS LIST PAGE (src/pages/CustomersPage.jsx)
- Implement a page with:
  - Header with "Customers" title and an "Add Customer" button.
  - Search input (filters by name/email/company).
  - Table: Name, Company, Email, Phone, Address, Actions (Edit/Delete).
- Clicking "Add Customer" opens a modal (no route change).
- Modal fields: name (required), email (valid email if present), phone, address, company.
- Validate on Save:
  - name required
  - email must be a valid email if present
  - phone min length 5 if present
- On Save:
  - If editing: update in place.
  - If new: generate id "c_" + random 6 chars, prepend to list.
  - Close modal and persist to localStorage.
- LocalStorage key: "flowventory:customers".
- On mount: load from localStorage; if empty, seed two rows:
  - { id:'c1', name:'Acme Inc.', email:'ops@acme.com', phone:'+1 555-0100', address:'NY, USA', company:'Acme Inc.' }
  - { id:'c2', name:'BlueBay Retail', email:'hello@bluebay.sg', phone:'+65 555-0123', address:'Singapore', company:'BlueBay' }
 
3) OPTIONAL CUSTOMER PROFILE (src/pages/CustomerProfile.jsx)
- Safe component for /customers/:id.
- Reads from localStorage; if not found, show “Customer not found” + link back.
 
4) DO NOT NAVIGATE ON CREATE/EDIT
- Add/Edit uses a modal component inside CustomersPage.
- Remove or ignore any "/customers/new" route; if it must exist, render a simple safe component that redirects to "/customers".
 
5) STYLING
- Use existing Tailwind setup.
- Keep to the product's "neon SaaS" cleanliness: rounded cards, subtle borders, hover states.
 
6) ACCEPTANCE TESTS (Frontend)
- Sidebar → "Customers" is visible and loads without errors.
- Click "Add Customer" → modal appears (page does NOT change route).
- Fill valid data → Save → new row appears immediately; refresh persists data.
- Edit an existing row → Save → changes persist after refresh.
- Delete asks confirmation and removes the row.
- Search filters by name/email/company.
- (Optional) Navigate to /customers/c1 → profile renders or shows "not found" safely.
 
DELIVERABLES
- src/pages/CustomersPage.jsx (modal-based create/edit, localStorage persistence, seeded data, validations)
- (Optional) src/pages/CustomerProfile.jsx (defensive "not found" message)
- Routes updated and sidebar link in place
